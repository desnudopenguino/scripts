*** Desnudo Penguino's Useful Scripts

I thought along with my dotfiles I should start keeping track of a bunch of random useful little scripts. Each script comes with a description, a list of dependencies (if any), and an example.

** eslint-notify

This script runs inotify that calls elsint on a file when it changes.

* Dependencies:
- eslint
- inotify-tools

* Example
`eslint-notify somefile.js`
